Huge  increase  in  edge  devices  over  the  world  with powerful  processors  inspired  many  researchers  to  apply  decentralized  machine  learning  techniques  so  that  these  edge  devices can  contribute  to  train  deep  neural  networks.  Among  those decentralized  machine  learning  schemes,  **federated  learning**  has gained  tremendous  sympathy  as  it  grants  _privacy_  to  the  edge devices   as   well   as   diminishing _communication costs_.   Having presented  well  performance  in  both  unbalanced  and  massively distributed data, the results for federated learning are promising, thus  it  paves  the  way  for  many  opportunities  in  various  applications  such  as: 
- Vehicular  networks
- Augmented reality based demonstration  in  museums or online games etc. 
- Drone  networks
- Smart  cities
